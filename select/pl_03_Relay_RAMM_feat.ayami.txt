I resent you for being raised
right
I resent you for being tall
I resent you for never getting
any opposition at all
I resent you for having each
other
I resent you for being so sure
I resent you presenting your
life like a fucking propaganda
brochure
And I see that you keep trying
beat me
And I love to get up in your
face
But I know it if I hate you for
hating me
I will have entered the endless
race

Wipe it all away
Wipe it all away
I used to go to the ferris wheel
every morning
Just to throw my anger out the
door
